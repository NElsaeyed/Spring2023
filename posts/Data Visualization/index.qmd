### Week Four: Data Visaulization

-   Data types: Show that you understand what is available to you in R. Note also, this goal overlaps with part of the midterm project. See the appendix on Data Types in the textbook for help. Write notes and R code chunks to demonstrate your knowledge

```{r}
# type of numeric data
typeof(10)
typeof(10.0)
typeof(10L)

# if you want to know if something is numeric (a double or an integer), you can use the function is.numeric() and it will tell you if it is numeric (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
is.numeric(10L)
is.numeric(10.0)
is.numeric("Text")

# Characters (also called “strings”) are any text between quotation marks.
typeof("This is a character string")
typeof('You can use double or single quotes')

# This can include quotes, but you have to escape quotes using a backslash to signal that the quote isn’t meant to be the end of the string.
my_string <- "The instructor said, \"R is cool,\" and the class agreed."
# cat() prints the arguments

cat(my_string)

# Logical data (also sometimes called “Boolean” values) is one of two values: true or false. In R, we always write them in uppercase: TRUE and FALSE.
class(TRUE)
class(FALSE)

```

```{r}
# assign 1 to the object named a
a <- 1
class(a)
typeof(a)
```

```{r}
# make a vector with a thing in it
a_thing <- 1
another_thing <- c(1,2)
many_things <- c(1:10)

# these are all now objects in the environment
```

-   Tidy Data: Show that you understand what this means. Give an example of data this is in tidy format, and data that is not.

```{r}
# load ggplot2 and some sample datasets
library(tidyverse)

# the starwars data is loaded by tidyverse
#assign the starwars dataset to a variable (object) name
starwars_copy<- starwars

# check out some of the data types
head(starwars_copy)
class(starwars_copy$name) 
class(starwars_copy$height)
class(starwars_copy$mass)
starwars_copy$sex
is.numeric(starwars$name)
is.numeric(starwars$height)
typeof(starwars$name)
typeof(starwars$mass)
typeof(starwars_copy$mass)

# plot some variables

```

-   ggplot2: We will continue learning about this across the semester. Show at a minimum that you can make a graph and add it to your blog. Try examples from the textbook. Show that you understand the layer concept. Identify aspects that are confusing to you so we can discuss them in class

```{r}
# make a data frame (table)
my_df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = c("one","two","three","four","five"), random = runif(5,0,1))

# access columns and rows with $ and []
my_df$a
my_df$random
my_df[1,] # row 1, all columns
my_df[,1] # column 1, all rows
my_df[1:2,] # rows 1 and 2, all columns
my_df[1:2,3] # rows 1 and 2, only column 3
```

```{r}
# load some sample data
survey_data <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v2/data/survey_data.csv")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot() # blank canvas
ggplot(data = survey_data, mapping = aes(x = wait_time, y = satisfaction)) # data to pull from and assigning axis 
# ggplot(survey_data, aes(x = wait_time, y = satisfaction)) shortened version of the same thing
ggplot(survey_data, aes(x = wait_time, y = satisfaction)) +      # the plus sign signals more info/layers
  geom_point() # scatter plot

ggplot(survey_data, aes(x = wait_time, y = satisfaction)) +
  geom_point(color="black", size=1) +
  geom_point(color="#afa0e8", size=0.5) + # use color name or hex number
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_smooth(method ="lm") # lm stands for linear model

```
