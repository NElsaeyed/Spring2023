## Notes

Here I will roughly draft some notes during class time, to be organized later.

**FEBRUARY 6th, 2023**

Using GitHub: generally a public platform

How to commit changes to GitHub:

Make changes on Posit\>Render\>Commit changes in GitHub and push.

This is for Github Desktop.

There is a way to do it on the browser when using Posit Cloud:

Git tab\>Commit\>Push

How to get a preview of the website while staying in RStudio:

Tools\>Global Options\>R Markdown\>Viewer pane

In the console: question mark before a function will open the help file for it.

String means text anything in quotes " "

Two question marks will open any file with the function name in it

Two number with a colon in between will give a sequence (1:5) will give 1 2 3 4 5

c() will make a list, separate the values by commas

\<- is an assignment of values to a name (which will show up in the environment)

sample(x = 1:6, size = 10, replace = TRUE, prob = rep(1/6,6))

x= the options to sample from

size= how many times to sample

replace= whether or not to exclude an option once it is sampled

prob= probability of choosing each option
