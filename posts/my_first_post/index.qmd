Welcome to my blog!

Here are some of my goals:

1.  To create a decent portfolio
2.  To. engage in a meaningful project related to my field
3.  To share my thoughts with other peers

And much more!

## An Introduction to Me and My Interests

I am a biology major with a minor in psychology, and I am planning to graduate in the coming December.

I want to build a career in research, and right now I am most fascinated in neuroscience. All of my hands on lab work has been in that field, and it has been the most interesting experience working with different PI's and graduate students on their projects for the last year.

Besides academics I dabble in traditional art like drawing and painting, as well as some graphic design. I consider myself a literature enthusiast, and I read ALOT!

This spring semester I hope to create a reference to using RStudio for data visualization that can help other upcoming scientist like myself, and that I can go back to in a pinch.
