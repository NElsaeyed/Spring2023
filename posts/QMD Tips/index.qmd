**Here are a few things we should be able to do by the end of week 3:**

**1. Be able to make a new .qmd document**

you can either copy a post file and rename it

or File\>New Quarto Document\> save as index.qmd in the posts folder

or from the File tab in the viewer side of RStudio (without the top level IML that sets the parameters of the document like title/author/date)

**2. Be able to render a .qmd document**

from the source, from the build tab or from the console

**3. Explain the difference between the source editor view and visual editor view in Rstudio.**

The visual view shows you the result of the formatting and how it would look in the website, while source view is just plain text with the markdown options

**4. Be able to insert simple markdown plain text (headers, lists, paragraphs), and render the document.**

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

-   unordered list

-   sub item 1

-   sub item 2

**5. Be aware of resources to help you learn more about markdown options.**

Markdwon basics on the CrumpLab website

*italics* and **bold**

superscript^2^ / subscript~2~

~~strikethrough~~

`verbatim code`

**6. Be able to insert an R code chunk, and show the output in the rendered document.**

``` default
write stuff
```

```{r}


```

```{r}
1+1
1:10
print("a title")

cat("and another title after it \n like this")
```

And use this for rendering without the grey box with th r code in it, output only

```{r}
#| echo: false

1:10
```

-   macro for quick insert

or use alt\>command\>i to automatically get the r block

**7. Running R code chunks in a qmd**

-   pressing play
-   copy/paste into console
-   highlight then command-enter (mac)to run selection at a time
-   precedence issues (first to last)

**8. Be aware of R code chunk options, and how to use eval, messages, error, warning, and echo.**

When you create a new code chunk you should notice that the grey box starts and ends with three back ticks \`\`\`. One common mistake is to accidentally delete these back ticks. Remember, code chunks and text entry are different colours - if the colour of certain parts of your Markdown doesn't look right, check that you haven't deleted the back ticks.

**9. Be able to set code chunk options per chunk, and/or for the whole document. Understand rules for precedence (which options will apply if both are set.)**

**10. Write inline r code.**

**11. Explain how the rendering environment is different from the Rstudio environment.**

**12. Be aware of more advanced quarto options for html documents, and try some of the options.**
