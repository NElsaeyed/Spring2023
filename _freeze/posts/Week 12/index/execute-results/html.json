In a typical Stroop experiment, subjects name the ink color of words as fast as they can. On congruent trials the color and word match; and, on incongruent trial the color and word mismatch. For a review of the Stroop effect see @macleod1991.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Stroop.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Stroop effect is the finding that reaction times are typically faster and more accurate on congruent compared to incongruent trials.\n\nThe Stroop effect could measure aspects of selective attention, or the ability to ignore distracting information. Selectively ignoring word information while attending to color information should cause smaller Stroop effects.\n\nIn the present study the researchers were interested in whether Stroop effects would be smaller in a condition when participants were standing up compared to sitting down. The general hypothesis was that standing up should improve selective attention abilities compared to sitting down, and this improvement would be detected in a smaller Stroop effect.\n\n## Data-sources\n\nThe authors have made their data available here <https://osf.io/uwzsb/>.\n\n## Original Figure\n\nThis final project will attempt to reproduce Figure 1 from the paper.

The above graph shows the same pattern of data as reported by the authors. The main finding was that the Stroop effect, or difference in reaction time between incongruent and congruent conditions was larger in the sitting posture condition compared to the standing posture condition. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that standing improves selective attention which caused a reduction in the Stroop effect\n\n![](Reports.jpg)\n",
