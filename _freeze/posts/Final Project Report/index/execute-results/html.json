D. (2016). Social Class and the Motivational Relevance of Other Human Beings: Evidence From Visual Attention. Psychological Science, 27(11), 1517--1527. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797616667721\n\nThe original hypothesis was that audio recordings of job candidates' speech will lead to higher ratings of intellect compared to written transcripts of the same speech content.\n\nIn my report,I calculated means and standard errors for the different rating types (Intellect, Impression, and Hire) based on the conditions (transcript and audio). The resulting graph presents the means as bars, with error bars indicating the standard errors. It also includes individual ratings as points.\n\nAccording to the graph, the rating for Hire Impression and Intellect were all higher in the audio condition, by almost double. You can see from the bar that the hiring increased the most in audio between the three rating types. These findings are consistent with the experiments hypothesis.\n\nThe article and its linked data can be accessed here:\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797616667721\n",
